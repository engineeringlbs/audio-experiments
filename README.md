Welcome to the W3 Audio Experiments project at the Engineering Labs!


## JavaScript WebAudio API and WASM

JavaScript has a well known API to play with audio, the [WebAudio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
This API provides _provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web_, 
but the audio processing requires computation-intensive processing that will causes performance
and UX issues. To avoid this performance issues and 

Why canâ€™t we keep things simple and perform the audio on the main thread?

- Audio processing is often computation-intensive. This is due to the large number of samples 
that need to be processed every second (about 44,100 samples each second).

- The JIT compilation and garbage collection of JavaScript happen on the main thread, and we
want to avoid this in the audio-processing code for consistent performance.

- If the time taken to process a frame of audio were to eat significantly into the 16.7 ms
frame budget, the UX would suffer from choppy animation.

- We want our app to run smoothly even on lower-performance mobile devices!
